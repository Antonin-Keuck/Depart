## View

You can see my web site on this url : https://antonin-keuck.github.io/Depart/#/

## Build

I provide a simple Makefile to build both docker and local environment

Such as:

``` make run-docker ```

I also have subset rules to easily run the project in development environment.

to know more about them:

```
$ make help
```

if you prefer to build-it the classic way:
```
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

Enjoy...
